# Logistic-Regression-Project
Objective of this project is to predict the need for hospitalization among COVID-affected patients using a logistic regression model. By analyzing certain patient attributes, the model aims to classify each patient into one of two categories: "Needs Hospitalization" or "Does Not Need Hospitalization".
